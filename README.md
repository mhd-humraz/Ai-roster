 
# 🤖🔥 AI Roast Machine (Manglish Edition)

Welcome to the **AI Roast Machine** – a fun and spicy web app that gives you light-hearted **Manglish (Malayalam + English)** roasts based on your input!  
Built with ❤️ using React, Tailwind CSS,  

## 🎯 Project Overview  
Ever wanted an AI that can *sarcastically roast you like your best friend*?  
This app does exactly that — it mixes Malayalam slang with English and generates harmless, funny comebacks that’ll make you laugh (and maybe cry a little 😂).

**Example roasts:** 
```
- “Bro, nee oru genius alle… but brain software still loading aayirikkum 😆”  
- “Ayyyo, ithra over confidence! NASA vilikkumbo ready aayikko 🚀”  
- “Coding alle favourite, but code run aavunilla 😜”
  ```

## 🧩 Features  
- 💬 Input box to describe yourself or your mood  
- 🔥 “Roast Me” button to generate AI roasts  
- 🌶️ Roast intensity selector – *Mild*, *Spicy*, *Extreme*  
- 🎨 Clean minimal UI (light theme with smooth animations)  
- 🎭 Fun Manglish roast responses using Gemini API  
- 📋 Copy roast button to share the burn  
- 🪄 Optional: “Roast of the Day” random mode
